      Hi, I'm Ido, I am a full-stack developer based in Israel. I enjoy working
      on projects that challenge me to constantly learn and improve my skills.
      Whether it's developing web applications or designing user interfaces, I
      love being part of the creative process and bringing ideas to life. I'm a
      musician at heart and love playing both the drums and guitar in my free
      time
