Development of a Redis server clone, written in the java language without external dependencies

Wrap was a Java project that serves as a learning resource for how Redis works, concurrency in Java and everything related.

Wrap supports strings, integers, hashmaps, unsorted AND sorted lists.
I enjoyed working on this project, I learned how to use the Reflection API to allow simple adding of commands, I also learned to implement skip lists, which are used in the sorted lists to reduce time complexity significantly.
