Development of a cloud provider website for SecureHost, a cloud servers provider based in israel

My objective was to develop a comprehensive platform that would help clients to manage their cloud servers with a single click, purchase a new server or upgrade an existing one and more.

Leveraging the power of Laravel with React and Tailwindcss, I delivered a solution that meet the requirements and brings efficiency and great user experience.

The website contains a landing page, products page for each category, user panel which allows users to start, stop and restart their own virtual machine, a purchase page and an admin panel that shows registered users, purchases and virtual machines owned by users.
